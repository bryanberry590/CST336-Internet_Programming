                <p class="bodyText"> 
                    C++ is one of the most popular programming languages (said by <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_intro.asp#:~:text=C%2B%2B%20is%20an%20object%2Doriented,fun%20and%20easy%20to%20learn!" target="_blank">w3schools</a>)
                    alongside other major languages like java. This language was developed by a Danish computer scientist named Bjarne Stroustrup
                    back in 1979 as said by <a href="https://www.perforce.com/blog/qac/misra-cpp-history" target="_blank">perforce</a>. 
                    C++ is another object-oriented programming language and it was was derived from C which is also an object-oriented 
                    programming language. This language is considered a high-level language which means that it can be read 
                    and interpreted easily compared to some other programming languages. C++ does a lot of things in the same way as java
                    with one of the main differences being that it does not have garbage collection.
                    This means that when you code in C++ you have to manage the memory usage manually or there can be problems in your program.
                    Although this can pose an issue to firt time learners, it does not hinder the ability of the language especailly since it is
                    up there in popularity with Java. C++ is commonly used in developing general applications and it is commonly seen in game development.
                    C++ is another great language to start with to help you build a solid foundation to carry with you throughout a programming/ computer science career.
