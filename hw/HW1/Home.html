                <p class="title">What are Programming Languages?</p>
                <p class="bodyText">Programming languages are a type of language that can be used to write instructions for computers to 
                   follow as said by <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/programming-languages/" target="_blank">codecademy</a>.
                   There are many different programming languages that all communicate with computers. Some languages work
                   more efficiently than others to accomplish certain tasks. A great example of this would be that if you were
                   going to program a website, you would use <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> instead of a language like python since HTML is meant for
                   web development. Another thing to note is that there are different levels of programming languages. High-level
                   programming languages are languages such as Java or C++ that can be <a href="https://codeinstitute.net/global/blog/what-is-a-programming-language/" target="_blank">understood and interpreted by humans </a> 
                   much easier than some other languages. The other languages that are very hard for humans to understand
                   such as assembly, are what we call low-level programming languages due to these languages not being "human friendly".
                   There are around <a href="https://careerkarma.com/blog/how-many-coding-languages-are-there/" target="_blank">9,000</a> 
                   currently existing programming languages which just shows how many there are to choose from
                   when learning. Finding the right language for a specific task that fits your understanding of programming is what makes
                   coding so enjoyable. Check out some hyperlinks above for more info on a few specific programming languages! </p>
