                    Assembly language is the first step up from binary code which is directly how machines read code.
                    Assembly is a low-level language which means that it is hard to read for humans but it communicates
                    with computers greatly. Although this is a disadvantage due to how complex it could be to learn and understand,
                    there are cases where using assembly is better than other languages. Assembly has many advantages such as 
                    allowing for better efficiency for system resources as well as better control over the machine it is being ran on.
                    Code written in assembly is also platform dependent. This means that code written on one machine with processor "x" will not
                    work on another machine with processor "y". In other words, assembly code will only work on multiple machines if those
                    machines share the same instruction set as said by <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/glossary/assembly-language/?orgRef=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F" target="_blank">lenovo</a>.
